We address issues like cyberbullying and trolling, food waste, disaster relief, etc... But it's also about learning and knowledge sharing. We invite beginners and more experienced developers to join events together and collaborate and create solutions together.

Based in Sweden, we organize meetups and hackathons in Stockholm and Gothenburg.
