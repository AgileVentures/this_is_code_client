## Site title and description

To add a title and description to each page, simply provide them to siteMetadata in your `gatsby-config.js` file.

```js
module.exports = {
  siteMetadata: {
    title: 'Gatsby Theme Carbon',
    description: 'A Gatsby theme for the carbon design system',
    keywords: 'gatsby,theme,carbon',
  },
  plugins: ['gatsby-theme-carbon'],
};
```

## Manifest

One of the first configurations should be to override the default manifest options, you can do this in `gatsby-config.js`. Any options you don't set, will be provided by the theme. See the example project.

```js
siteMetadata: {
    title: 'Gatsby Theme Carbon',
  },
  plugins: [
    'gatsby-theme-carbon',
    {
      resolve: 'gatsby-plugin-manifest',
      options: {
        name: 'Carbon Design Gatsby Theme',
        short_name: 'Gatsby Theme Carbon',
        start_url: '/',
        background_color: '#ffffff',
        theme_color: '#0062ff',
        display: 'browser',
      },
    },
  ],
```

## Favicon

If you need to override the default favicon, you can do so by passing a relative path to the icon. It's recommended to provide a 512 x 512 version.

**IMPORTANT:** For best results, if you’re providing an icon for generation it should be…

- at least as big as the largest icon being generated (512x512 by default).
- square (if it’s not, transparent bars will add to make it square).
- of one of the follow formats: JPEG, PNG, WebP, TIFF, GIF or SVG.

```js
plugins: [
    {
      resolve: 'gatsby-theme-carbon',
      options: {
        iconPath: './src/images/custom-icon-512.png'
      },
    },
  ],
```

## Additional font weights

If needed, you can add support for additional Plex font weights. Don't forget to specify italics for the additional weights if needed.

```js
plugins: [
    {
      resolve: 'gatsby-theme-carbon',
      options: {
		// will get added to default [300, 400, 600]
        additionalFontWeights: ['200', '200i]
      },
    },
  ],
```

## Image compression

You can enable WebP by passing `withWebp: true` or providing your own optimization level. See the gatsby-remark-images [plugin options](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-remark-images/#options). You can also tweak the image quality based on design tolerance and performance thresholds.

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: 'gatsby-theme-carbon',
      options: {
        withWebp: true, // true, false (default false)
        imageQuality: 50, // 0-100 (default 75)
      },
    },
  ],
};
```

## Global search

Site-wide search is provided by the theme. The only requirement for a page to show up in the results is for it to have `title` set in the [frontmatter](/components/markdown#mdx-frontmatter).
To render more helpful search results (and improve SEO), you'll want to make sure your pages have `description` set in the frontmatter as well.

Global search is enabled by default. To disable it, set the `isSearchEnabled` option to false.

```js
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: 'gatsby-theme-carbon',
      options: {
        isSearchEnabled: false
      },
    },
  ],
```

Under the hood, we use [Lunr](https://lunrjs.com/) to create our search index. If necessary, you tweak the search scoring algorithm and source nodes.
To do so, provide your own [resolvers object](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-lunr/#getting-started) to the `lunrOptions` theme option.

## Edit on GitHub link

To add a link to the bottom of each page that points to the current page source in GitHub, provide a `repository` object to `siteMetadata` in your `gatsby-config.js` file. You can provide a `baseUrl`, and if needed, the `subDirectory` and `branch` where your site source lives.

```js
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: 'gatsby-theme-carbon',
      options: {
        repository: {
          baseUrl: 'https://github.com/carbon-design-system/gatsby-theme-carbon',
          subDirectory: '/packages/example',
          branch: 'master',
        },
      },
    },
  ],
```

## Other options

- `additionalFontWeights` – add support for additional Plex font weights. Don't forget to specify italics for the additional weights if needed.
- `mdxExtensions` – change the file extensions processed by `gatsby-mdx` (default ['.mdx', '.md'])
- `titleType` – pick between four formats for the `<title>` element for your site. Here are the four options using this page as an example:

  - `page`: "Configuration" (default)
  - `site`: "Gatsby Theme Carbon"
  - `append`: "Gatsby Theme Carbon – Configuration"
  - `prepend`: "Configuration - Gatsby Theme Carbon"

```js
plugins: [
    {
      resolve: 'gatsby-theme-carbon',
      options: {
        additionalFontWeights: ['200', '200i'],
        mdxExtensions: ['.mdx'],
        titleType: 'append'
      },
    },
  ],
```
